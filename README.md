# My web scraping projects

The repo contains web scraping projects that can be divided into three categories:

- Projects from online courses and books (like
  the [getting_structured_data]('https://github.com/DrPoppyseed/web_scraping/tree/main/getting_structured_data') repo)
- Scrapy projects that I created (
  like [sanfranciscan]('https://github.com/DrPoppyseed/web_scraping/tree/main/sanfranciscan')
  and [cwur]('https://github.com/DrPoppyseed/web_scraping/tree/main/cwur') repos)
- Projects for cleaning data and scrapers built without scrapy
  in [cleaning]('https://github.com/DrPoppyseed/web_scraping/tree/main/cleaning')
